## Comparison Targets (v2)

Based on baseline, v2 should aim for:

| Metric | Baseline | v2 Target | Rationale |
|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Total duration (complex) | | -20% | Parallelization |
| First-pass rate | | Same or better | Gates catch issues early |
| Retries per workflow | | Same or fewer | Better arch/spec |
| Manual interventions | | Tracked | Currently unknown |
